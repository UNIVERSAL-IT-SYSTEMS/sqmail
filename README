SQmaiL
======

This is a terribly old MUA that I wrote in 2001, which stores all its
messages in a MySQL database and supports SQL virtual folders.

I never got round to writing a README back then, and it was all stored
in CVS and I hadn't discovered tagging, so the exact revisions of what
version maps to what is likely lost forever. The CVS to git conversion
seems a little broken to.

I cannot in all honesty recommend that anyone use this for anything, but
interested parties might like to check out the (converted) original
website at:

It's GPL'd.
